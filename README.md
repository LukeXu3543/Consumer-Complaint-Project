# Consumer-Complaint-Project
The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database.  In this project, I will be using Python to analyze the data, aiming to find a pattern for different variables within the dataset. I will be using different charts to visualize my analysis, and I will also try to fit the data to a logistic regression model.

Notice that the Plotly choropleth plot cannot be displayed in the notebook, so I attached a picture of it to the repository. In a real notebook, users can
move the cursor to zoom in and out and hover over the plot to find out the complaint cases reported for each state of the US.
